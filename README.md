# Project-Nautilus

## Synopsis

Reskinning the Cypher System sheet for Tidal Blades.

## Note

This version of the sheet requires a Pro level account with Roll20, in order to utilize custom character sheets.

This sheet is a reskin/realignment of the Cypher Systems By Roll20 Sheet. As such, it can be installed on top of an existing Cypher Systems game and will work correctly.
